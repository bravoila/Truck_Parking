For the truck parking project
Upon this rock, we will build our church

Input files are in cmake-build-debug for convenience.
POD_info is for partial OD data.
RestA_info contains the rest area infomation.

Output file are RestArea.txt and Truck.txt.

All function are in the main.cpp. 
method2.cpp, parctice.cpp and WangHeader.h is not in use right now.

Build route:
Apr 13 2018: consider re-enter the highway, going to seperate segment simulation and circular simulation. 
Apr 17 2018: change output file type to .csv; 
	     need to figure out why cannot input csv file
	     going to seperate segment simulation and circular simulation.
	     i.segment is used to simulate a line and first part of circular simulation.
	     ii.circular is used to simulate circular, start from one rest area to another.  
		consider changing array to vector.
Apr 18 2018: Seperate circular simulation code, need to figure out random figure problem.
	     Needs to split the file to header and cpp file.
	     Consider re-entry from rest area after long rest by circular simulation.
	     RestA_info2.txt only contains the id and location info of rest area.
Apr 19 2018: Fix some bugs of output csv file
Apr 20 2018: Fix some bugs of output csv file and endless loop, more test data needed.
	     Change the arrival function to double-head normal distribution so as to mimic real condition.
	     Needs to figure out why rest area number does not change.
Apr 23 2018: Test for large data set. Needs to test on other machine. m value is not stabel. Don't know why.
Apr 24 2018: Change the random generater. Test for L=100.
